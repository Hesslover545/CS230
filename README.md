*Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their game, Draw It or Lose It, across multiple platforms. Their main requirement was to ensure cross-platform compatibility, meaning the software needed to work on Windows, Mac, and mobile devices. The system needed to handle multiple simultaneous users, efficiently manage memory and storage, and maintain performance consistency regardless of the platform.

*What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

One of the strongest aspects of my documentation was clarity and structure. I thoroughly outlined the software architecture, data flow, and key design decisions, making it easy to follow for both developers and stakeholders. I also ensured that the documentation covered edge cases, scalability concerns, and system constraints, which helped align the development process with the project requirements.

*What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a detailed design document before coding made the actual development much smoother. It allowed me to; Define the system architecture upfront, reducing the need for major redesigns later. Anticipate potential challenges, such as memory constraints or performance bottlenecks. Ensure alignment with user needs and client expectations, minimizing scope creep. By having a structured roadmap, I was able to write more efficient, maintainable, and scalable code.

*If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part, I would improve the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) considerations. While I focused heavily on backend architecture and system functionality, I could have included mockups or wireframes to give a better visual representation of the user experience. To improve it, I would use prototyping tools like Figma or Balsamiq to create sample UI layouts, conduct usability testing with potential users to refine interface decisions, and integrate accessibility considerations to ensure the software is user-friendly for all audiences.

*How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on scalability, efficiency, and ease of use. For example, I chose efficient data structures to optimize performance, to implemented lazy loading and caching to improve memory management, and to designed the system to be platform-agnostic, ensuring a smooth experience regardless of the device. Considering the user’s needs is critical because software that doesn’t align with user expectations leads to low adoption rates, usability issues, and increased maintenance costs. A user-centered approach ensures the system is intuitive, functional, and valuable to the target audience.

*How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing the software using a modular and structured development process. My key techniques included; breaking down the system into independent modules, making it easier to maintain. Using Big-O analysis to ensure efficient algorithms and data structures. Applying cross-platform development principles to maximize compatibility. And following an agile methodology, allowing for iterative improvements. In the future, I would enhance my process by Incorporating more real-world user testing early in the design phase, leveraging cloud-based architectures for better scalability, and using automated performance testing to identify and fix bottlenecks before deployment. This structured approach will ensure future projects are scalable, efficient, and user-friendly from the start.
